### Hello, fellow nerds ðŸ‘‹
I code on occasion, believe it or not. My latest endeavor involves the creation of my university's CS club website for the first time in a decade! I've also been dabbling in sports journalism/photography with hopes of advancing into NASCAR.
One day, I hope to to utilize NR2003's (the definitive NASCAR game) stellar physics model to bring it up to modern-day standards.
